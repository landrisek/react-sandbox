# Philosohophy of react-sandbox:<br>
1) You can use any language (PHP, golang, java) to create componet with method preparing array data of [react props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) which are persistent and immutable.<br>
2) Your component should be force by interace[link] to provide link which will be called on background and treat state of react component which is mutable. 
3) Your controller render one or more of your Component extending class Control[link] with application logic. Your component should not contain more component with application logic (forms, grid, etc), only call or overload any of Control[link] methods. This methods return subcomponent without application logic (input texts, checkboxes, paginator, validators). Validators and others subcomponent are equal in architecture. We believe that component are often combination of data grids and forms. In that case it is not good idea to separate state of this component or create dependencies between them. E.g. cleanness of code can benefit when data grid have one state with filtering form. Thus we do not operate with term "form" or "grid" in documentation hovewer you are free to use react-sandbox in this way.
